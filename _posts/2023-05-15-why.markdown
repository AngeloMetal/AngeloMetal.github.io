"The point of this blog" you might ask? Well, besides fun:

* It improves communication and writing skills. 
* It acts as repository to my knowledge. 
* It improves technical skills, because the process of explaining complex concepts in simple terms reinforces my understanding. Also, “If you can't explain something to a first year student, then you haven't really understood.” - [R. Feynman][1]
* Networking.

Ok, so the real question now: why "angelo dot one"? No particular reason.

Just as [Vsauce][2], "angelo.1" was randomly picked. Although instead of fakenamegenerator.com, I used a comparably inferior source of randomness; ~~[xkcd][3]~~ human brain. If "angelo.1" does not seem random to you, then good. That's the [moral of the story][4].
